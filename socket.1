.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Socket
creates an Internet domain TCP or a UNIX domain stream socket and connects it to stdin and stdout.
The 
.I host
argument can be an Internet number in dot-notation (like
``130.149.28.10'') or a domain name. In this case it must be possible
to resolve the name to a valid Internet address with
.IR gethostbyname (3).
The 
.I port
argument can be a port number or a service name which can be mapped to
a port number by
.IR getservbyname (3).
If an UNIX domain socket is wanted to be created instead of an Internet
socket, specify the 
.I path
instead of an internet (canonical domain named or dot-notated) host.
The hostname is treated as a pathname if contains at least a single 
slash. I.e. if one wants to create or connect to a socket in the current 
directory, use 
.I ./filename
to specify the connection point.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "\-b " (background)
The program forks itself into the background, detaches from its
controlling tty, closes the file descriptors associated with the tty,
and changes its current directory to the root directory.
.TP
.BR "\-B " "(local address)"
This option specifies which
.I local address
to binded to when making a connection.
.TP
.BR "\-c " (crlf)
Linefeed characters (LF) are converted to a Carriage Return Linefeed
sequence (CRLF) when written to the socket.
CRLF sequences read from the socket are converted to a single LF.
.TP
.BR "\-f " (fork)
When a server connection has been accepted, a separate process is
forked to handle the connection in background.
.TP
.BR "\-l " (loop)
(only valid with
.BR \-s )
After a connection has been closed,
another connection is accepted.
.TP
.BR "\-p " (program)
The specified 
.I command
is executed for each connection. Its standard input, standard output,
and standard error channels are connected to the socket.
.I Command
can be any shell command since it is passed to \fC/bin/sh\fP.
.TP
.BR "\-q " (quit)
The connection is closed when an end-of-file condition occurs on standard
input.
.TP
.BR "\-r " "(read only)"
No data is read from standard input and written to the socket.
.TP
.BR "\-s " (server)
A server socket is created.
A
.I hostname 
argument is not required of Internet sockets, only the port number 
but a pathname is required for UNIX domain sockets.
.TP
.BR "\-v " (verbose)
Messages about connections etc. are issued to stderr.
.TP
.BR "\-w " "(write only)"
No data is read from the socket and written to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-version
.B Socket
prints its version ID and terminates. 
This must be the first argument to have an effect.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.IP
\fCsocket -v coma.cs.tu-berlin.de nntp\fP
.LP
connects to the nntp port (port 119) of coma.cs.tu-berlin.de
(130.149.28.10).
.br
The command
.IP
\fCsocket \-sl 3425\fP
.LP
creates a server socket on port 3425 on the local host and waits for a
connection.
After a connection has been closed, a new connection is accepted. 
.br
The command
.IP
\fCsocket \-wslqvp "echo Socket! " 1938\fP
.LP
creates a server socket on port 1938 on the local host and waits for a
connection.
When a connection is accepted, the string "Socket!" is written to the
socket.
No data is read from the socket and written to the \fCfinger\fP
program.
The connection is closed when an end-of-file condition at the standard
output of the program  occurs.
Then a new connection is accepted.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Lots of diagnostics for failed system calls.
.TP
.BI "unknown host " host
.IR host 's
address could not be resolved.
.TP
.B Signal \fIsignal\fP caught, exiting
.B Socket
exits on any signal other than SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGCLD, SIGQUIT.
.LP
A non-zero exit code is returned if 
.B socket
terminates due to an error condition or a signal.

.SH BUGS
\fCsocket \-p\fP terminates due to a SIGPIPE signal when there is more
data from the socket available than the executed program wants to
read.
.LP
Please report any other bugs to the author.
